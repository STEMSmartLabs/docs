# Temperature & Humidity

The **DHT11 sensor** allows your projects to measure **ambient temperature and humidity**.  
It is one of the most commonly used sensors in DIY electronics and IoT, helping students connect code with real-world environmental data.

## What It Does
This example reads the **current humidity** from the DHT11 sensor and displays the values.  
It gives you a simple way to monitor your surroundings and respond to changes in the environment.

## Real-World Applications
Temperature and humidity monitoring is an essential part of many real-life systems, such as:

- 🏠 **Smart Homes** – Automating fans, air conditioners, and humidifiers.  
- 🌱 **Smart Agriculture** – Monitoring greenhouse or soil conditions to protect crops.  
- 🌍 **Weather Stations** – Collecting local climate data for learning or prediction.  
- 🏥 **Health & Safety** – Ensuring comfortable and safe indoor environments.  
- 📦 **Logistics & Storage** – Monitoring warehouses for sensitive goods like food or medicine.  

By using the DHT11, students learn how **data from the environment** can trigger real-world actions and innovations.

✅ With the DHT11 sensor, students can build projects that **sense, respond, and adapt to environmental conditions**, making their prototypes more intelligent and practical.
