# Blink LED

The **LED (Light Emitting Diode)** is the simplest and most widely used electronic component for beginners. Blinking an LED is often called the "Hello World" of electronics—it’s the first step in learning how to control hardware with code.

## What It Does
This program turns an LED **ON and OFF repeatedly**, creating a blinking effect. It helps students understand the basics of **digital output control** and how timing works in programming.

## Real-World Applications
Though simple, the principle of blinking an LED extends to many real-life systems:

- 💡 **Indicators** – Status lights on appliances, chargers, or devices.  
- 🚦 **Traffic Lights** – Signaling patterns for vehicles and pedestrians.  
- 🏠 **Smart Home Devices** – Visual alerts for notifications or alarms.  
- 🔋 **Battery & Power Indicators** – Showing charging or low-battery states.  
- 🕹️ **Learning Foundation** – Forms the basis for controlling more advanced outputs like motors, displays, and sensors.  

Mastering this exercise builds the foundation for **all digital control projects**.

✅ Once you can blink an LED, you’ve taken the first step toward controlling **any electronic component** with code.
