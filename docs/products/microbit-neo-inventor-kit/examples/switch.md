# Switch

A **switch** is one of the most basic input components in electronics. Unlike a button that is momentary, a switch **stays in its position**—ON or OFF—until you change it. This makes it ideal for controlling power, modes, or states in your projects.

## What It Does
This example reads the state of a switch and shows how your program can react depending on whether the switch is ON or OFF. It introduces the concept of **toggle inputs**, which are widely used in real devices.

## Real-World Applications
Switches are everywhere in daily life and technology. Some common uses include:

- 💡 **Power Control** – Light switches, appliance ON/OFF switches.  
- 🏠 **Smart Homes** – Controlling fans, lights, or connected devices.  
- 🎮 **Mode Selection** – Changing between game modes or difficulty levels.  
- 🤖 **Robotics** – Enabling/disabling features, reset switches, or safety locks.  
- 🧪 **STEM Projects** – Teaching logic control, toggling states, or acting as a manual override.  

With a switch, students learn how devices **store state** and how physical inputs can control digital systems.

✅ Once you can read a switch input, you can use it to **turn LEDs on/off, change motor states, toggle alarms, or even switch between entire program modes**.
