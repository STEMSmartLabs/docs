# Buzzer

The **passive buzzer** can generate tones of different pitches and durations. By controlling frequency, you can play simple sounds, melodies, or alerts in your projects.

## What It Does
This example makes the buzzer play tones at different frequencies, allowing you to create beeps or simple music. It’s a fun way to combine coding with sound output.

## Real-World Applications
Buzzers are found in almost every electronic system where **sound feedback** is needed:

- 🔔 **Alarms & Alerts** – Door alarms, smoke detectors, and timers.  
- 🎵 **Musical Projects** – Simple games, learning tools, or electronic instruments.  
- 🕹️ **Interactive Systems** – Sound feedback for buttons or sensors.  
- 🏠 **Appliances** – Microwave beeps, washing machine alerts, or reminders.  
- 🤖 **Robotics** – Sound signals for status updates or warnings.  

With a buzzer, students learn how to **add sound feedback** that makes their prototypes more interactive.

✅ Once you can play tones, try creating **sound effects, melodies, or alarms** that respond to sensor inputs, making your projects more dynamic.
