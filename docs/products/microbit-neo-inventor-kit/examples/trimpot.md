# Trimpot

A **trimpot** (trimmer potentiometer) is a type of variable resistor. By turning its knob, you change the resistance, which the micro:bit reads as an **analog value**. This allows you to create projects where input can vary smoothly rather than being just ON or OFF.

## What It Does
This example reads the analog value from the trimpot and shows how it changes as you rotate it.  
The output ranges from **minimum** to **maximum**, depending on the position of the knob.

## Real-World Applications
Potentiometers and trimpots are used in many devices where adjustable control is needed:

- 🔊 **Volume Knobs** – Adjust sound levels in speakers and amplifiers.  
- 💡 **Light Dimmers** – Smooth control of brightness.  
- 🕹️ **Control Interfaces** – Joysticks, sliders, or adjustable inputs.  
- ⚙️ **Calibration Tools** – Fine-tuning circuits or sensor values.  
- 🎮 **STEM Projects** – Controlling motors, LEDs, or variables in code interactively.  

Using analog inputs like a trimpot helps students understand how to handle **continuous values** in coding.

✅ Once you can read analog values, you can use the trimpot to **control LEDs, motor speed, buzzer pitch, or even act as a game controller input**.
