# Servo Motor

Servos are simple motors that can rotate to specific angles, making them perfect for projects where **controlled movement** is required.  In this example, you will learn how to sweep a servo back and forth smoothly.

---

## What It Does
The program sends signals to the servo motor, moving it gradually from one side to the other and back again. This creates a continuous sweeping motion, which can be adapted for many practical applications.

## Real-World Applications
Servos are widely used in everyday systems and prototypes, including:

- 🤖 **Robotics** – Arm joints, grippers, and head movements.  
- 🏠 **Smart Home Devices** – Automated curtains, window openers, and locks.  
- 🚗 **Automotive Systems** – Steering mechanisms in small robotic cars or models.  
- 🎮 **Interactive Projects** – Pan/tilt camera mounts, animatronics, and hobby projects.  
- ✈️ **Aerospace Models** – Controlling rudders, flaps, and control surfaces in model aircraft.  

By mastering servo control, students can design prototypes that involve **movement, automation, and interaction** with the physical world.

✅ Once you understand how to sweep a servo, you can expand this idea into **real-world prototypes**—from robotic arms to smart devices that respond to user input.
