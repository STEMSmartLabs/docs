# Button Input

Buttons are the simplest way to provide **user input** to your projects. A momentary button closes the circuit only while pressed, allowing your code to respond to taps, presses, or long holds.

## What It Does
This example reads the state of a button and shows how your program can respond when the button is pressed. It introduces the concept of **digital input** and forms the basis for interactive projects.

## Real-World Applications
Buttons are everywhere in electronics, from toys to industrial systems. With button inputs, students can create:

- 🎮 **Game Controls** – Simple joysticks, trigger buttons, or start/stop inputs.  
- 🔔 **Doorbells & Buzzers** – Triggering a sound or notification.  
- 🏠 **Smart Home Controls** – Light switches, fan toggles, or appliance triggers.  
- 🤖 **Robotics** – Manual override or reset buttons.  
- 🧪 **Learning Experiments** – Teach the basics of logic, inputs, and event-driven programming.  

Using a button, students begin to understand how **human interaction** drives digital systems.

✅ Once you can read a button press, you can extend it to **control LEDs, buzzers, motors, or even start whole projects** with a single press.
