# IR Remote Receiver

The **IR (Infrared) Receiver** allows your project to read signals from a standard IR remote control.  
Each button on the remote sends a unique digital code, which your program can decode and use to trigger actions.

## What It Does
This example listens for incoming signals from an IR remote and **displays the decoded button codes**.  
Once you know the code for each button, you can program the micro:bit to perform specific tasks whenever that button is pressed.

## Real-World Applications
Infrared communication is used widely in everyday devices. With the IR remote and receiver, students can learn about **wireless control systems** such as:

- 📺 **Consumer Electronics** – TVs, projectors, and set-top boxes.  
- 🏠 **Smart Home Devices** – Remote-controlled fans, lights, and appliances.  
- 🚗 **Toys & Models** – Remote-controlled cars and robots.  
- 🎮 **Custom Controllers** – Build your own remote-controlled prototypes.  
- 📡 **Learning Tool** – Understand how data is transmitted wirelessly using light signals.  

By decoding IR signals, students get hands-on experience with **remote control technology** and can extend it into **custom automation projects**.

✅ Once you’ve learned to decode button presses, you can map each button to control **motors, LEDs, fans, or even trigger full projects** with just a click of the remote.
