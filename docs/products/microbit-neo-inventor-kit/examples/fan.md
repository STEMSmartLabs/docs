# Motor with Fan

The **DC motor with fan** demonstrates how to control rotational motion using code.  
By turning the motor ON or OFF (and adjusting speed if supported), students can explore the basics of **automation, airflow, and motion control**.

---

## What It Does
This example drives a small fan connected to the motor, increasing and decreasing the speed in a controlled sequence. It introduces the concept of using code to control mechanical systems.

## Real-World Applications
DC motors are everywhere in everyday life and engineering. They can be used in:

- 🌬️ **Cooling Systems** – Fans for computers, appliances, and smart devices.  
- 🚗 **Automotive Applications** – Motors in car windows, mirrors, and ventilation systems.  
- 🏠 **Smart Home Projects** – Air purifiers, exhaust fans, or simple household automation.  
- 🤖 **Robotics** – Wheels, conveyor belts, and moving mechanisms.  
- 🧪 **STEM Prototypes** – Demonstrating airflow, motion, and energy conversion concepts.  

Controlling a motor gives students confidence to build **practical prototypes** that integrate both electronics and mechanics.

✅ With a motor and fan, students can begin experimenting with **movement, airflow, and automation**—skills that extend directly into robotics, IoT devices, and real-world engineering solutions.
